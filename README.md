## Living Systematic Review Methods 
PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, European Medicines Agency (EMA) trial registry, and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) are configured to send automated monthly search updates according to the defined search strings (under data folder). Potentially eligible trials are transferred to Rayyan monthly by one author by rotation (IZ, DK). Searches in trial registries and conference proceedings are performed once yearly (MP). Once yearly, in December, eligible trials are selected from all searches by two authors (IZ, DK) and added to the systematic review. We extract the data and update the table of included studies, the risk of bias assessment, meta-analyses, and summary of findings tables, as necessary once yearly. The updated results will be available on this site with the last search date. When updates are no longer possible (personnel time availability), an end date will appear on the website.
