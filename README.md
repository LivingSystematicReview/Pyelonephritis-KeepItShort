# Short versus long antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs: a living systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs 
The last ten years have brought many changes and debates to the infectious disease community, and past long-standing clinical paradigms have been questioned. One such debatable paradigm is the duration of antibiotic treatment for bacterial infections. For many years, the standard approach was to prescribe more prolonged courses of antibiotics, typically quinolones for 7 to 14 days or more, to achieve a cure and prevent relapse or the development of antimicrobial resistance. However, accumulating evidence began to shift this paradigm, and many new clinical trials and systematic reviews showed that shorter treatment regimens could be just as effective, paving the way for a new era of “Shorter is better”.

Current evidence on the treatment of pyelonephritis and complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) among adults points to the efficacy and safety of treatment regimens of 5-7 days. Nevertheless, there are notable gaps in the evidence concerning specific patient groups. Notably, the optimal treatment duration is unclear for men, for antibiotics other than quinolones, and for severe sepsis and bacteremia, which limits the ability to make fully informed recommendations for these populations.

Since the last published systematic reviews, new randomized controlled trials have been conducted, some of which include the previously mentioned underrepresented populations. In this systematic review, we aim to update the evidence on short antibiotic treatment regimens for pyelonephritis and cUTI among adults and to analyze data from sub-groups of interest. As this is a topic of ongoing and accumulating evidence, we plan this to be a living systematic review. A living systematic review can help clinicians and researchers update on this topic yearly, without waiting for additional reviews to reinforce their decision to adopt the “shorter is better” approach.

## Living Systematic Review Methods 
PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, European Medicines Agency (EMA) trial registry, and the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) are configured to send automated monthly search updates according to the defined search strings (under data folder). Potentially eligible trials are transferred to Rayyan monthly by one author by rotation (IZ, DK). Searches in trial registries and conference proceedings are performed once yearly (MP). Once yearly, in December, eligible trials are selected from all searches by two authors (IZ, DK) and added to the systematic review. We extract the data and update the table of included studies, the risk of bias assessment, meta-analyses, and summary of findings tables, as necessary once yearly. The updated results will be available on this site with the last search date. When updates are no longer possible (personnel time availability), an end date will appear on the website.
